Problems
========
- Add Hessian to LogisticRegression
- Implement Least Squares, SVM

Optimizers
==========
- Implement proximal based optimizer like FOBOS
- Implement Nesterov's accelerated gradient
- Implement (L-)BFGS
- Implement Newton's Method with Equality Constraints
- Implement infeasible start Newton's method
- Implement primal-dual interior point solver

Testing
=======
- Make harness for testing multiple problems on an optimizer

Constraints
===========
- Add better support inequality constraints. There's gotta be something better
  than a log barrier function.
- add support for finding an initial solution
- Add Hessian to LinearEquality

General
=======
- added symbolic problem definitions
- add translation between single vector input and multiple arguments
- Implement some method to check convergence using duality gap
- Implement some convergence criteria based on size of gradient
- Add some ways to visually inspect convergence. Logging and plotting a must.
